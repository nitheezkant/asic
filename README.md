# Task 1 
## Compiling a C program using GCC and RISC-V

### 1. Compiled C code using GCC

Wrote a simple c program and compliled it uising standard C compiler. This is shown in the below screenshot.

### 2. Compiled C code using RISCV compiler.

Next the same c file was comipled using RISCV compiler. The below command is used to do the same. 

```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
```

Next the follwing command is used to view the assembly level code of the same.

```
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o | less
```

The below screenshot shows the terminal excecution of the same.

The below screenshot shows the main function of the program.

Next the following command is used to compile using the Ofast 
option.

```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
```

The main function is now seen to have lesser instruction as seen in the screenshot.

# Task 2

## Viewing Program output and Debugging the program


### 1. Program Output


Once compiled using the RISCV compiler, the follwing command can be used to view the output. 

```
spike pk sum1ton.o
```

The follwing screenshot shows the result and verifies that both gcc and RISCV compiler give same output.

## 2. DEBUGGING

To debug instruction by instruction, the follwing commands can be used to go to a perticular instruction and then excecute command by command. 

```
spike -d pk sum1ton.o
until pc 0 100b0
```

Further after each instruction the values of the registers can be obtained in the follwing way.

```
reg 0 a0
```

These are demonstrated in the below screenshot.
